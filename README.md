##Contributing

### setting up the dev evironment
I recommend using the vercel cli (you can sign up with github when it asks for an account)
```bash
yarn install
vercel dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your own version is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
